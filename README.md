# Apartment::Sidekiq

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/apartment-sidekiq.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/apartment-sidekiq)

Official Support for Sidekiq with the Apartment Gem.

This gem takes care of storing the current tenant that a job is enqueued within.
It will then switch to that tenant for the duration of the job processing.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ros-apartment-sidekiq', require: 'apartment-sidekiq'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ros-apartment-sidekiq

## Usage

That's it. There's nothing to do. Each job that is queued will get an additional entry
storing `Apartment::Tenant.current` when it is queued. Then when the server pops it,
it will run job within an `Apartment::Tenant.switch` block.
